# The backlog of bl

Everything left to do lives in `.abydos/backlog/`, as files. There is no
database and no server: the state of an item is the folder it is in, its
history is `git log`, and every tool that works this backlog — the app,
the command line, you — is reading and moving the same files.

Read this before your first move. The commands below are
`abydos-backlog`, which is installed with the app; everything it does
you could also do with `mv` and an editor, and knowing that is the point
— nothing here is locked behind the tool.

## The layout

    .abydos/backlog/
      AGENTS.md          this file
      project.md         what this project is, for somebody who has never seen it
      config.json        which assistants work this backlog
      spec/              what the project does today, one file per capability
      open/              written down, not yet agreed
      ready/             agreed — anybody, or any agent, may start
      in-progress/       being worked on now
      waiting/           stuck on something that is not work
      completed/         done, keeping its number
      history/           the commit log from before the backlog. Never added to.

## An item

Either one file:

    open/0443-the-capsule-is-clipped-at-a-large-zoom.md

or a folder, when it carries something a file cannot hold:

    open/0443-the-capsule-is-clipped-at-a-large-zoom/
      task.md            the item itself — the same markdown either way
      images/            screenshots, recordings, a log somebody saved
      spec/              what this change does to the global spec

Both shapes are read the same way, so use whichever fits: a task that is
only words stays one file. `abydos-backlog attach <number> <file>` turns
a file into a folder and puts the file in `images/`, so you never have
to convert one by hand.

The number is given once, when the item is written, and never changes
again. Moving an item between states moves its file or its folder and
takes the number with it.

### What an item says

A title as the first heading, then what is wrong or what is missing,
written for somebody who has not been looking at this all week. Then, and
this is the part that makes the backlog worth more than a list of titles:

- **Ruled out** — what has already been tried and did not work, and why.
  Several items here have most of a day of searching in them. The point
  is that the next person does not repeat it.
- **Steps** — the work as a checklist, in the order it happens.

### The checklist

`## Steps` is how anybody looking at this item — a person, the board in
the app, the next agent to touch it — can tell what is done and what is
still missing. It is the one part of an item that is *not* a description
written once. Keep it current:

    ## Steps

    - [x] Find where the pane's width comes from
    - [x] Ask tmux instead of the window
    - [ ] A test that fails with the old answer
    - [ ] Write down here what was ruled out on the way
    - [ ] `spec/terminal.md` says what the project now does

The rules are short, and all of them exist because the opposite has
happened:

- **Tick it when it is done, in the same change that does it.** Not at
  the end from memory — a checklist reconstructed afterwards is a
  summary, and a summary of your own work is always finished.
- **Never tick ahead.** A `[x]` means somebody could go and look at it
  now. An item that says four of five with nothing to show for any of
  them is worse than an item that says nothing.
- **Add steps as you find them.** Work that turns out to be needed goes
  on the list, even though it makes the fraction go backwards. That is
  the number being honest, which is the only reason to have it.
- **A step is something you can tell you have finished.** "Fix the
  terminal" is not one. "Ask tmux for the pane width" is.
- **Do not delete a step you decided against.** Tick nothing, and say
  underneath why it is not being done — that is a thing the next person
  needs to know, and a deleted line tells them nothing.

One list, not two. An item used to carry a plan and a separate list of
what would make it done, and by the end the two always disagreed.

The last two steps are on every item: what you ruled out on the way, and
the spec. Both are below.

### The estimate

`## Steps` says how much is done. `## Estimate` says how much longer it
has, and that is a judgement rather than a count, so somebody has to make
it:

    ## Estimate

    2026-08-11 14:20 — about an hour left

One line, the time first, written by whoever is doing the work.
`abydos-backlog eta <number> "about an hour left"` writes it and stamps
it; `--clear` takes it out. Absent is fine — a section with a line of
prose in it and no timestamp reads as no estimate, which is what a
freshly filed item has.

The time is not decoration. An estimate is a claim with a moment
attached, and "about an hour" that does not say whether it was judged
four minutes ago or four hours ago is a number believed because it is
displayed. That is also why the card prints the time it was said rather
than how long ago: a card is drawn for as long as nothing changes, and
"said 5m ago" would still say that three hours later.

## The spec

`spec/` says what the project does *today*, one file per capability, as
requirements:

    ## Requirement: A pane keeps its ligatures when another is focused

    Prose, and then the cases that show it.

    ### Scenario: two panes, the second focused

    - **Given** two panes showing the same file
    - **When** the second is focused
    - **Then** the first still draws `!=` as one glyph

A backlog forgets. A finished item is a paragraph about a day in March,
and once enough of them are in `completed/` the only remaining account
of what the program does is the program. The spec is the other account:
the thing somebody can read in an afternoon, and the thing to hand an
agent before it starts.

Keeping it true is a step of doing the work, not a tidy-up afterwards.
So an item that changes behaviour carries a **delta** — `spec/<capability>.md`
inside the item's folder — naming what it changes with one of three
verbs:

    ## ADDED Requirement: Images scale inside tmux

    …the requirement, written as it will read in the spec.

    ## MODIFIED Requirement: A pane keeps its ligatures when another is focused

    …the whole requirement as it will now read, not a description of the edit.

    ## REMOVED Requirement: The old thing

    …one line on why it is gone.

Three verbs and not four: a rename is a `REMOVED` and an `ADDED`. A rule
that only moves the heading would quietly keep the old sentence under the
new name, which is exactly the drift the spec exists to prevent.

    abydos-backlog spec add <number> <capability>

starts one. It makes the item a folder if it is not one yet, and puts the
names of the requirements already in that capability at the top of the
file — a `MODIFIED` has to name one of them exactly, and getting that
wrong is the commonest way a delta fails to fold.

`abydos-backlog spec check <number>` says whether the delta still fits
the spec — a `MODIFIED` for a requirement nobody can find means the spec
moved since the item was written, and that is worth knowing before you
start rather than at the end.

## Filing something new

    abydos-backlog new "The capsule is clipped at a large zoom"
    abydos-backlog new "…" --files      # a folder, for a screenshot

It lands in `open/` with the next number and a template. Fill it in. If
you have a screenshot, `abydos-backlog attach <number> <path>`.

New items go to `open/`, not to `ready/`. `ready` is a promise that the
deciding is done, and it is not yours to make on your own behalf.

## Picking up a ready item

This is the loop. Do it in this order.

1.  `abydos-backlog next` — the lowest-numbered item in `ready/`, or
    nothing. Nothing means there is nothing to pick up; do not go
    looking in `open/`.
2.  Read `project.md` and the parts of `spec/` the item touches. Then
    read the item, all of it, including what has been ruled out.
3.  `abydos-backlog start <number>` — makes a worktree of its own on
    branch `backlog/<number>-<slug>`, and moves the item to
    `in-progress/`. Work there and nowhere else: another agent may be
    doing the same thing to another item in the same repository, and
    two of you in one working tree is one of you losing.
4.  Fill in `## Steps` before you start, if it is thin. You have just read
    the item and the spec, and this is the only moment you know what the
    work is and have not started it yet.
5.  Do the work. Commit as you go, small commits, in that worktree, and
    **tick each step in the commit that finishes it**. `abydos-backlog
    show <number>` prints the list back with the fraction, and the board
    in the app reads that same checklist out of *your worktree* — the
    card says `3/6 in the worktree` beside the branch — so somebody
    watching can tell what is done and what is still missing without
    asking. The board finds your copy by number, so it goes on showing
    your progress after `done` has moved it to `completed/` on the
    branch.

    **Keep an estimate**, in `## Estimate`, of how much longer the item
    has:

        abydos-backlog eta <number> "about an hour left"

    which stamps it with the time — the item's own markdown, so it
    travels with the work and the card shows it beside the fraction. A
    few words, not a paragraph: a card has room for `about an hour left,
    as of 14:20` and not much more. What makes one worth having is that
    it is *revised*, not set once and left: say it again when the work
    turns out to be bigger as readily as when it turns out to be
    smaller. An item claiming two hours for the sixth hour running is
    worse than one claiming nothing, and `--clear` is there for when you
    genuinely no longer know.

    Nothing computes this and nothing should. Elapsed time over steps
    ticked would need nobody to write anything and would be confident
    and wrong: steps are not the same size, and three small ones in ten
    minutes followed by two hours on the fourth would show twenty
    minutes remaining for the whole of those two hours.
6.  Write the spec delta — `spec/<capability>.md` in the item's folder —
    if the behaviour changed. `abydos-backlog attach` if there is
    something to show.
7.  Write into the item what you found: what you ruled out on the way,
    what surprised you. This is what makes it worth reading later.
8.  `abydos-backlog done <number>` — folds the delta into `spec/` and
    moves the item to `completed/`. It will refuse nothing and tell you
    everything: any part of the delta that would not fold is printed,
    and you fix it and run it again.
9.  Push the branch. Do not merge it yourself unless you were asked to.

A step still unticked at 9 is either work you did not do — say so in the
item and leave it unticked — or a step you finished and forgot to mark.
Do not tick the second kind on the way past without checking which it is.

The move to `completed/` is on your branch, so until it lands the project's
own copy of the item stays in `in-progress/`. That is not a mistake to go
and fix by hand: the item is finished when the work is, and the work is in
a branch nobody has taken yet.

Where the item *is* and how far along it is are two different questions,
and the board answers them from two different copies for that reason: the
folder from the project, because that is the answer to "what is nobody
working on"; the checklist, the estimate, the pictures and the delta from
your worktree, because that is where they are being written.

If you get stuck on something that is not work — a crash that will not
happen again, an answer somebody else has to give — move the item to
`waiting/` and write in it what it is waiting *for*, so it is obvious
when the wait is over.

## What not to do

- Do not renumber anything. A commit message from last year cites these
  numbers.
- Do not add to `history/`. It is the commit log from before the backlog
  and it stops where it stops.
- Do not move something into `ready/` to give yourself work.
- Do not rewrite an item you did not do. What it says is what somebody
  knew at the time, and that is its value.
- Do not fold a delta into `spec/` before the work is done and committed.
  The spec says what the project *does*, and a requirement in it that
  nothing implements is worse than no requirement at all.
